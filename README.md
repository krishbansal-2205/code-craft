## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Code Craft running locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), or [bun](https://bun.sh/)
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account for authentication.
- A [Convex](https://convex.dev/) account for the backend and database.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishbansal-2205/code-craft.git
   cd code-craft
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add your Clerk and Convex credentials. You'll typically need:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
   CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=
   ```

   - Obtain your Clerk keys from the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).
   - Obtain your Convex URL after deploying your Convex backend (`npx convex deploy`).
   - The `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is used for syncing user data with Convex via webhooks (see `convex/http.ts`).

4. **Deploy Convex Backend:**
   Navigate to your project root and deploy your Convex schema and functions:

   ```bash
   npx convex dev # For development with a local backend and dashboard
   # or for a hosted development/production deployment:
   npx convex deploy
   ```

   This will also generate necessary files in the `convex/_generated` directory.

5. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
